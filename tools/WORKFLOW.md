# Developer and Release Workflow

The `main` branch represents the most recent released version. Annotated
`vX.Y.Z` tags preserve each release. Development for the next release occurs on
a matching `vX.Y.Z` branch.

## 1. Develop on the version branch

Commit and test changes on the active version branch:

```bash
git status --short
cargo check
cargo test
```

## 2. Finalize metadata and changelog

Update the active changelog entry and propagate current metadata into managed
files:

```bash
./tools/changelog-update.sh
```

Review and edit the active release summary and notes in `changelog.json` when
needed, then regenerate the Markdown changelog:

```bash
./tools/genmd-changelog.sh
```

Commit the final documentation and metadata changes before building release
artifacts.

## 3. Build release binaries

On the macOS build host:

```bash
./tools/build-release.sh
```

Copy the versioned macOS binaries from `build/` to the Linux build host's
`build/` directory.

On the Linux build host:

```bash
./tools/build-release.sh
```

The Linux host produces the enabled Linux and Windows targets. The collected
`build/` directory should then contain every target enabled in `metadata.json`.

## 4. Stage the release

Validate the complete artifact set, copy the versioned binaries into `dist/`,
and generate `dist/SHA256SUMS`:

```bash
./tools/stage-release.sh
```

Smoke-test the staged binaries on their target operating systems before
publishing the release.

## 5. Merge, tag, and push the release

The version branch and working tree must be clean:

```bash
./tools/main-merge.sh
git push origin main
git push origin --tags
```

`main-merge.sh` merges the version branch into `main`, creates the annotated
version tag, and removes the local version branch.

## 6. Publish the GitHub release

Create a GitHub release from the new version tag. Upload:

- Every versioned binary from `dist/`.
- `dist/SHA256SUMS`.
- Release notes based on the current changelog entry.

Verify that every README download link works after the assets finish uploading.

## 7. Start the next version

From the clean, current `main` branch:

```bash
./tools/new-version.sh
```

This creates the next version branch and updates version metadata. README
release filenames and links are updated by `tools/metadata-update.sh`.
