BOREAL is a local desktop application that inventories and organizes metadata
from the services you choose. Its browser-based dashboard makes large data
collections easier to search, audit, classify, and prepare for migration.

BOREAL currently supports:

- Local files, including duplicate-file analysis
- Persons, groups, organizations, and account relationships
- Google Drive: My Drive, Shared Drives, and Shared with me
- GitHub repository metadata
- S3-compatible object storage
- Keeper shared-folder metadata

BOREAL runs on Linux, Windows, and macOS. Its interface and private inventory
database stay on your computer. It manages its own Rclone installation and
normal use does not require administrator privileges.
